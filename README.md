# Predictive-Analysis-of-Liver-Disorders-in-Indian-Patients-Using-KNN-Algorithm
The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) contains medical records from Andhra Pradesh, India, aimed at helping detect liver diseases early. It includes demographic info and blood test results, supporting the development of ML models to predict liver conditions and assist in better diagnosis.
# ðŸ©º Predictive Analysis of Liver Disorders in Indian Patients Using KNN Algorithm

This project focuses on predicting liver disorders using the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)** and the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The goal is to support early diagnosis of liver disease based on clinical and demographic features.
